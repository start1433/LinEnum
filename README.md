Note: Export functionality is currently in the experimental stage.

General usage:

version 0.6

* Example: ./LinEnum.sh -k keyword -r report -e /tmp/ -t 

OPTIONS:
* -k	 输入关键字
* -e	 输出配置文件位置
* -t	 彻底测试
* -r	 输出报告位置
* -h	 帮助.
Example: ./LinEnum.sh -r 11.txt -e out 
将报告输出到 11.txt中，配置文件输出到当前位置的 out文件夹中。


Running with no options = limited scans/no output file

* -e Requires the user enters an output location i.e. /tmp/export. If this location does not exist, it will be created.
* -r Requires the user to enter a report name. The report (.txt file) will be saved to the current working directory.
* -t Performs thorough (slow) tests. Without this switch default 'quick' scans are performed.
* -k An optional switch for which the user can search for a single keyword within many files (documented below).
